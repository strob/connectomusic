a graph-based neurally-inspired composition suite.

working with historical images in augmented UI (digitize.py,
qDrawGraph.py), we create digital graph representations from bitmap
images. nodes are encoded with their x,y position and edges assume a
cost equal to their spatial distance.

a suite of samples are assigned to nodes based on the total number of
outbound edges, and when a node ``fires,'' it both plays whatever
sample is associated and releases (in time proportional to distance)
neighboring nodes for attenuated triggering.

to consider:

 - connecting the four corners as a single point

 - left-channel/right-channel (simple+complex image?)
   mix two runs -- (L->L.5, R.5->R)

 - repetition v destruction v deterioration                      
   loop: as regulation

 - loopable

a graph-based neurally-inspired composition suite.

working with historical images in augmented UI (digitize.py), we
create digital graph representations from bitmap images. nodes are
encoded with their x,y position and edges assume a cost equal to their
spatial distance.

a suite of samples are assigned to nodes based on the total outbound
cost of its edges, and when a node ``fires,'' it both plays whatever
sample is associated and releases (in time proportional to distance)
neighboring nodes for attenuated triggering.

to consider:

 - accumulating a ``charge'' in nodes with a certain quantity needed
   to fire;

 - repeaters, amplifiers, inhibitors;

 - performance v. composition
